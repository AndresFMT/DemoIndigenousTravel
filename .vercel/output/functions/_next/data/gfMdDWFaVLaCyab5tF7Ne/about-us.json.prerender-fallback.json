Leadership and collaboration are necessary for the Indigenous tourism sector in Manitoba to recover and prosper. This begins with a robust and vibrant Indigenous Tourism Manitoba Association that has a strong voice to lead and advocate for the sector. Chaired by Dave Daley of Wapusk Adventures, this organization has the support of both Travel Manitoba (TMB) and the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada (ITAC).\n\nWorking together with industry partners provincially and nationally, ITM is furthering the progress of the Indigenous tourism industry to provide the current 150 Indigenous tourism operators in Manitoba with greater access to marketing, development, and partnership opportunities. The services we pro- vide bring both domestic and international visitors to Indigenous tourism businesses and contribute to Indigenous economies. Indigenous Tourism Manitoba provides opportunities to share Indigenous culture, stories, and art throughout Manitoba.","textColor":{"_type":"color","alpha":1,"hex":"#494949","hsl":{"_type":"hslaColor","a":1,"h":55.86206896551753,"l":0.2874,"s":0},"hsv":{"_type":"hsvaColor","a":1,"h":55.86206896551753,"s":0,"v":0.2874},"rgb":{"_type":"rgbaColor","a":1,"b":73,"g":73,"r":73}},"title":"About Us Text","type":"sectionText"}],"description":null,"title":"About Us Text Section","type":"sectionText"}],"title":"About Us"},"__N_SSG":true}
